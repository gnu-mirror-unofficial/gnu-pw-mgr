New in 2.2 - June, 2018

* Chase Bank has added the password restriction that no three characters
  may be in sequence. So look for that and fix it, if need be.

* Let people know when they last modified a password.
  Mark the day when the pbkdf2 count is modified.

* The confirmation value printed out is a hash based on the confirmation
  string and the current password. So, if the password changes, then
  so does the confirmation string. Not ideal. This change restricts
  the hashing source to just the password id and the confirmation
  string.

* Users may now specify a config file other than the default.

New in 2.0 - May, 2016

* A new option --shared to implement sharing passwords.
  This allows shared logins with secure passwords and still
  keeps all the other passwords very secret.  See the docs for
  the rationale and usage.

GNU gnu-pw-mgr "manages" passwords by re-computing them on demand.
It does an sha256 sum of a long, unguessable string stored in a
protected file conjoined with a never-recorded private permutation of
a domain name.  The result is cropped and twiddled in repeatable ways
to satisfy the password requirements of the intended web site.
By basing the check sum on a permutation of a domain, it winds up
easier to have different passwords for different domains than to
overuse a single password.

Since its initial release, none of the algorithms have changed, so
previously created passwords will still be produced by this modified
program.

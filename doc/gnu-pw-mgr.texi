This program is designed to make it easy to reconstruct difficult
passwords when they are needed while limiting the risk of attack.
The user of this program inputs a self-defined transformation of a web site
URL and obtains the password and user name hint for that web site.
You must, however, be able to remember this password id, or the password
is lost forever.

The Wikipedia has an 
@uref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength,excellent article}
on passwords in general and there is a
@uref{http://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/pwdhash.pdf,paper published at Stanford}*
that describes a browser plug-in that is substantially similar to this program.

	@table @samp
	@item tag
	These are displayed next to each displayed password to help identify them.
	@item text
	This is not displayed, but is used for the SHA initial value.
	This may be arbitrarily long.
	@item ver
	The version of @code{gnu-pw-mgr} used to initially store the seed.
	This is used to determine the password tweaking algorithm to use
	when the generated password does not meet the site criteria
	(@pxref{gnu-pw-mgr password-options,,
	the password character class option}).  On rare occasions, new
	character class restrictions may cause a change in the algorithm
	used to tweak passwords.  When this is done, the old algorithm
	is still used to tweak passwords from the older seeds.
	@end table

	It is expected that when you must create a new password for an
	existing site, you will add a seed to your config file.  Specify only
	the @code{--tag} and @code{--text} command line options and the
	program will insert the new triplet into the configuration file.
	Specify only the tag and no other command line arguments, and the
	associated seed entry will be removed.  After that, every password id
	will have a new "most recent" password associated with it.  You are
	expected to gradually update all of your passwords and retire seed
	values no longer in use.

	New sites will not need a new seed.  Simply supplying the new
	@code{<pw-id>} command argument will yield a new password.

	@table @samp
	@item upper

	is a no-op.

	@item no-alpha
	Alphabetic characters are prohibited.  This conflicts with
	@samp{upper}, @samp{lower} and @samp{alpha}.

	@item digit
	There must be at least one decimal digit character.

	@item no-triplets
	When three characters in a row are the same, the third is fiddled.
	Letters are changed to the next letter and @code{z} becomes @code{a}.
	Digits are handled similarly.  Special characters are replaced with
	the third possible special character (@code{-}, unless modified with
	@code{--specials}).  (Yes, there are a few such sites.)

	@item special
	The password must contain at least one @samp{special character}
	(a non-alphabetic, non-digit character).

	@item no-special
	The password must not contain any characters that are not alphabetic
	or decimal digits.

	@item pin
	The password is all digits, a Personal Identification Number.
	This is an abbreviation for @code{no-alpha + no-special + digit}.

	@item alnum
	This is an abbreviation for @code{alpha + digit}.

	@item two-*
	Two of a particular character class are required.
	Specifying this implies "at least one of" the specified type.
	Two upper case, lower case, punctuation (special) and digit
	characters may be specified this way.

	Before running the program to print a password, you must first

	gnu-pw-mgr --tag "first-seed-tag" --text \
	"This is only a 'test'.  Were it *real*,
	you _would_ likely know?"
	@end example

	These two strings along with a password id are used to create a
	@samp{sha256} hash code password.  So, now you are able to print a
	password.

	@example
	gnu-pw-mgr --login-id "user-name" --length 32 \\
	    --cclass=upper,lower,digit,special \\
	    my example.com
	@end example

	In this example, the password id is the string "my example.com".
	The space character is inserted between the command line operands.
	The options are associated with this id via another @samp{sha256}
	sum of just the id.  The "user-name" would typically be either your
	actual user name for the site, or something that could readily
	remind you of the login id.  If omitted, just do not forget it.
	The length specifies the maximum length allowed for a password on the
	site.  You will get a password of that length.  The @code{--cclass}
	defines the allowed and/or required character class(es) for the
	passwords for the site.

	With the above seed and invocation, you will see printed out exactly
	this:

	@example
	seed-tag     login id hint: user-name   pw:
	first-seed-tag iQiF1g5aLQ0JqFIUbR/svpTS+F/PCeoy
	@end example

	Henceforth typing just @samp{gnu-pw-mgr my example.com} will always
	yield this output.  The options above are now associated with the
	password id via a hash code.  The @code{gnu-pw-mgr} database (either
	@file{~/.local/gnupwmgr.cfg} or @file{~/.gnupwmgrrc}, but the former
	preferred) will now be this (hash code abbreviated):
